For auth,
- table of valid link auth:
    - creation metadata (creator, timestamp, reason)
    - associated Person object
    - secret value
    - expiration time
- allow entering email address in a form and generating email with link (maybe)
- definitely support a mail-merge mechanism for generating these initially
- (mostly) ignores normal authz mechanisms
    - separate view
- if a Person has a User associated (or vice-versa) should we disable this and expect them to use the normal password reset?
