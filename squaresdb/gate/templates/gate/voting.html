<h1>Voting members</h1>

<p>Dances included:</p>
<ol>
    {% for dance in dances %}
    <li>{{dance}}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ol>

<p>Below find a list of everyone who attended <em>any</em> of the above dances. It's left to the viewer to filter for "has attended <em>enough</em>", consider any additional dances (for example, if you're figuring out who will be a voting member in a couple weeks), and adjust for any dances that shouldn't be included (for example, a Saturday dance or one that will be too far back).</p>
