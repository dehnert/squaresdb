# Tech Squares MemberDB

The Tech Squares MemberDB (also known as SquaresDB) will track the membership of [Tech Squares](https://www.mit.edu/~tech-squares/), as well as facilitating the nightly [gates and books jobs](https://www.mit.edu/~tech-squares/howto/).

In particular, goals include:
* Membership tracking
  - Centrally update email addresses on all (or most) Tech Squares mailing lists, and update membership
  - Allow members to tell us their highest level
* Attendance tracking
  - Gate: Potentially ease signin by having a searchable list of members (rather than scanning through dozens of sheets of paper, in three alphabetical chunks)
  - Books: Eliminate the "read through the signin sheets" part of books -- it'll just be a matter of counting cash, doing a little arithmetic, and making sure it matches
  - Voting membership: Provide an easy report listing voting members, rather than combing through the signing sheets
